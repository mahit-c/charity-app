# charity-app
This repo consists of a basic charity application (Give Hope) built using React Native. The application allows users to create collections, add charities to the respective collections, login/signup, etc. 

To run the app, please download the GiveHope file and run it on a platform of your choice (Ideally VSCode). You will need an access to an emulator (preferably IOS running iPhone 4 to get the best experience).

NOTE: You may also need to additionally install the node modules expo folder.
